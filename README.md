Calculator Project from The Odin Project

My attempts in this project:
 - Use objects to encapsulate and make testing easier
 - Use CSS Grid

What I learned:
 - Much better at using objects to write cleaner code
 - Used CSS Grid effectively to create the calculator 

What I need to improve:
 - Still need to study more about encapsulation
 - More planning! More flow chart, pseudocode, etc. to anticipate some of the problems I faced late in coding (overuse of booleans, for example)
