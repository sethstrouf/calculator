Calculator Project from The Odin Project

My attempts in this project:
 - Use objects to encapsulate and make testing easier
 - Use CSS Grid

What I learned:
 - Much better at using objects to write cleaner code
 - Used CSS Grid effectively to create the calculator 

What I need to improve:
 - Still need to study more about encapsulation
 - Could have written this better with fewer boolean checks, just not sure how right now
 - More planning! More flow chart, pseudocode, etc. to anticipate some of the problems I    faced late in coding (overuse of booleans, for example)
 - Definitely some bugs, will come back and fix when I'm better at programming
